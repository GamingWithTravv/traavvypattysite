    Hello there! This website is currently under construction. Honestly, I’m not exactly
    sure what I want to do with this page yet. I’m not quite at the level where I can drop 
    merch or do anything big like that, so for now, this page might just chill here until I 
    figure things out. I got this honestly as a joke but kinda forgot I had it so it kind of
    just sat here for a while.
    <p>
    In the meantime, you can keep up with everything I’m doing by checking out my socials. I’m 
    always posting updates, content, and more over there. My Linktree has all of my social links 
    in one place — you can find it at <a href="https://linktr.ee/traavvypatty" target="_blank">https://linktr.ee/traavvypatty</a>. 
    Or, just search <strong>@traavvypatty</strong> — I use the same handle everywhere (except Instagram. I
    don’t have one).
    <p>
    Thanks for stopping by and sticking around! Be sure to keep an eye on my socials and the Discord 
    server to catch any updates when things change. Hopefully I’ll have something cool to put here in 
    the near future. Until then, take care and stay tuned! ;)
